<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>Typora requires Pandoc (≥ v1.20). If you do not have Pandoc or only
old version of Pandoc installed on your machine, you could:</p>
<p>Download installer from <strong><a
href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest">Download
Page</a></strong> and install or update <a
href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>For windows users, if typora still saying it cannot found Pandoc, you
may need try to restart your PC.</p>
<h1 id="pandoc-integration">Pandoc Integration</h1>
<p>In Typora, import function and export function for some file formats
(including docx, odt, rtf, epub, LaTeX and wiki) are powered by a 3rd
party software named Pandoc. Those features requires Pandoc (≥ v1.16) to
be installed.</p>
<p>Please note that install Pandoc is optional for Typora, if you do not
need those advanced import/export support in typora, then you do not
have to install Pandoc on your computer.</p>
<p>This document would show how to install Pandoc and use Typora with
Pandoc for full import/export functions.</p>

<p>Briefly speaking, there are two recommended ways.</p>
<h5 id="install-from-downloaded-package-installer">Install from

<p>Download a package installer from pandoc's <a

<p>For developers using <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>,
installing pandoc can be one line from terminal:</p>

<h2 id="use-pandoc">Use Pandoc</h2>
<p>After Pandoc is installed, then you could import supported file types
by clicking File -&gt; Import from menubar, or simple drag and drop a
file into typora. Export function is also fully functional from menubar.
Pandoc will run in backgrounds for those tasks and then exit
automatically, so you may not feel it.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h4 id="which-version-of-pandoc-is-supported">Which version of pandoc is
supported ?</h4>
<p>Versions ≥ 1.16 is required. The latest version, the better. So
updating pandoc is encouraged if your pandoc version is too old.</p>
<p>#### Can typora work without pandoc ?</p>
<p>Yes, only import and export (other than html/PDF file types) needs
it.</p>
<h4 id="which-file-types-can-be-imported-or-exported-by-typora">Which
file types can be imported or exported by typora ?</h4>
<p>Import supports file with extesion: .docx, .latex, .tex, .ltx, .rst,
.rest, .org, .wiki, .dokuwiki, .textile, .opml, .epub.</p>
<p>Export supports file formats of: HTML, PDF (these two does not need
Pandoc), Docx, odt, rtf, Epub, LaTeX, Media Wiki.</p>
<p>Pandoc should support more file types which typora did not integrate,
detailed info is <a href="http://pandoc.org/">here</a>.</p>
<h4
id="whats-the-difference-between-exporting-by-typora-and-exporting-by-using-pandoc-from-command-line">What's
the difference between exporting by typora and exporting by using pandoc
from command line ?</h4>
<p>Exporting by typora is also powered by Pandoc, yet typora will not
convert directly from markdown to target file type, instead, it converts
to an inner format pandoc can read and then write as target file type,
so, in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you run pandoc from command line, then you need to specify its
markdown parser from (pandoc Markdown, <a
href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, <a
href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown
Extra</a>, <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">GitHub-Flavored
Markdown</a>), while exporting using typora, typora will pass its inner
AST to pandoc for file conversion. In other words, the format of blocks
or inline elements in exported output will always be consistent as what
you see in typora and exported HTML/PDF. Yet, the styling maybe
different.</li>
<li>Some markdown syntax invented by pandoc Markdown, like citations,
are not supported when you exporting from typora, since only markdown
syntax typora support will be correctly exported. But we may support
more extended markdown syntax in future.</li>
<li>If you use typora for exporting, then<code>[TOC]</code> will be
correctly exported for all file types. Highlight and underline will be
supported for LaTeX, rtf, Epub, wiki formats and sometimes Docx. Yet,
they are only supported for HTML based file formats in raw Pandoc. Other
block and inline elements is basically both supported by raw pandoc and
typora+pandoc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="can-all-blockinline-element-types-be-exported-correctly">Can all
block/inline element types be exported correctly ?</h4>
<p>Task list is not supported yet. Underline and highlight for
<code>.docx</code> is supported only if they are not used inside or
outside other inline styles. Underline and highlight is not support for
OpenOffice(<code>.odt</code>). Embedded .gif file is not support for
LaTeX. Other block or inline elements can basically be exported. But the
styles cannot be 100% match when import/export.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-uninstall-pandoc-for-mac">How to uninstall pandoc for mac

<blockquote>
<p>If you later want to uninstall the package, you can do so by
downloading <a

script</a> and running it
with <code>perl uninstall-pandoc.pl</code>".</p>
