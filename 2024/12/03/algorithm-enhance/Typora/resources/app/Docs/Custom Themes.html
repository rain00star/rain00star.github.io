<p>Typora has 5~6 built-in themes. Changing writing theme can be done by
selecting theme under the <code>theme</code> menu bar. You could also
download, install, modify or write your own custom theme to stylize
Typora.</p>
<p>Typora use CSS to stylish all contents, each theme under
<code>theme</code> menu is one <code>.css</code> files under "typora's
theme folder". So, briefly speaking, you could add/modify themes by
adding/modifying correspond css files under "typora's theme folder".</p>

<p>Sometimes, you may just want to change font family for all themes,
for change font-color for headings for a specific themes. In this case,
you do not need to copy/modify a whole exiting css file, just <a
href="http://support.typora.io/Add-Custom-CSS/">Add Custom CSS</a> is
enough. In brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create &amp; write a <code>base.user.css</code> under theme folder,
the css rules inside it will be applied to all themes.</li>
<li>Create &amp; write a <code>{theme-css-name}.user.css</code> under
theme folder, the css rules inside it will only be applied to theme file
<code>{theme-css-name}.css</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the built-in CSS theme files will get overwritten
completely on typora version up, so, write your custom css into
<code>*.user.css</code>, instead of the existing files, will prevent
your modifications from being lost after update.</p>
